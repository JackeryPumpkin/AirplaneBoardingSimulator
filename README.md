# AirplaneBoardingSimulator
Simulator program I wrote using a heap priority queue to compare the times taken to board passengers with dynamically created unique simulator "engines" that determine priority in their own ways. 
On run the program will read in three data files of passengers, spin up the necessary PriorityQueues, process each data file with each simulator engine, then output the boarding data results to three text files.
